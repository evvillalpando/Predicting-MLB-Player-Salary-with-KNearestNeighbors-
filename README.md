# Predicting MLB Player Salary with KNearestNeighbors and Random Forests

In this project I built a model to predict player Salaries in the MLB, using performance and salary data from the years 2000-2016. The model performed reasonably well, but I speak in detail on its shortcomings and what can be improved. The formatting for the PDF is a bit funky, so I would recommend the HTML for reading through it.
I had a lot of fun with this one, so while the content is quite stats-y, I think it draws some interesting conclusions digestible to all. :)
